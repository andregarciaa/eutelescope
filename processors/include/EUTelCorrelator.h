  //! Hit and cluster correlator
  /*! This processor makes histograms that show the correlation
   *  between clusters of a detector and another.
   *  We study the correlation between centre of clusters' X and Y
   *  separately.
   *  At the end of our study we'll have (n*n - n) histograms for X
   *  and (n*n - n) for Y ( n is the number of our detectors ). We
   *  have this number of histograms because we don't create those
   *  histograms where there will be the correlation between a
   *  detector and himself.
   *  These histograms are put into different directories,
   *  one for X and one for Y, with cluster and hit correlation too.
   *  For each directory we have pairs of histograms that differ only
   *  in the order of DetectorID and these result with X and Y
   *  reversed, but otherwise they are the same.
   *  We do the same for hit correlation.

   *  produced by previous processors like EUTelClusteringProcessor or
