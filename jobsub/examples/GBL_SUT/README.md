# Example for a EUTelescope analysis using the GBL processors for evaluating a scatterer (SUT) with material budget imaging (MBI).

Detailed information on how to use EUTELESCOPE software is available at http://eutelescope.desy.de

## Prerequisites

Source the build_env.sh from the EUTel main directory to set the correct environment:

`source $EUTELESCOPE/build_env.sh`

## Running

The analysis we want to perform is controlled by a config file (config.cfg), a csv-table (runlist.csv) and steering file templates (*.xml), all located in the working directory.

You can set the variables for your working directory here as well as input parameters for the different processors.


There a two different versions, one for raw-data taken with EUDAQ1 and one with already converted data files taken with EUDAQ2.

### EUDAQ2 version

You should be able to run the analysis now. For this, execute the following commands one after another and check for each of the processors to successfully finish.

First example is a homogenous aluminium plate (3mm thickness) as SUT:

```
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g noisypixel 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g clustering 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g hitmaker 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL2 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL3 699
jobsub -c config_AluSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g fitGBL 699
```

Second example is a copper sample, providing four different regions with 0/25/50/100% X/X0:

```
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g noisypixel 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g clustering 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g hitmaker 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL2 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL3 681
jobsub -c config_CuSample.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g fitGBL 681
```

### EUDAQ1 version

For this version, one has to convert the file in the first step. Furthermore, it is then needed to change the inputs for the following processes to the newly created LCIO file.
Please have a look in the steering-templates for noisypixel and clustering; here comment out the current LCIOInput and take the other provided one.
Then the analysis should work in the same way:

```
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g converter 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g noisypixel 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g clustering 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g hitmaker 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL2 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g alignGBL3 110
jobsub -c config_DESY2017.cfg -csv runlist.csv -g fitGBL 110
```

## Output

At every step a ROOT file is created, containing a set of histograms, which you can be found at output/histograms/ after completion.
Most interesting here is the displayed scattering map for the kinks in x and y direction of the SUT, which are stored in the fitGBL histogram file.
